        'Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight
        So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight
        Shoes on, get up in the morn'
        Cup of milk, let's rock and roll
        King Kong, kick the drum, rolling on like a Rolling Stone
        Sing song when I'm walking home
        Jump up to the top, LeBron
        Ding dong, call me on my phone
        Ice tea and a game of ping pong, huh
        This is getting heavy
        Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (woo hoo)
        Life is sweet as honey
        Yeah, this beat cha-ching like money, huh
        Disco overload, I'm into that, I'm good to go
        I'm diamond, you know I glow up
        Hey, so let's go
        'Cause I-I-I'm in the stars tonight
        So watch me bring the fire and set the night alight (hey)
        Shining through the city with a little funk and soul
        So I'ma light it up like dynamite, whoa oh oh
        Bring a friend, join the crowd
        Whoever wanna come along
        Word up, talk the talk
        Just move like we off the wall
        Day or night, the sky's alight
        So we dance to the break of dawn
        Ladies and gentlemen, I got the medicine
        So you should keep ya eyes on the ball, huh
        This is getting heavy
        Can you hear the bass boom? I'm ready (woo hoo)
        Life is sweet as honey
        Yeah, this beat cha-ching like money
